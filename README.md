## Installation

```bash
# Install the package
npm install llm-select-and-chat

# Install peer dependencies (if not already in your project)
npm install react react-dom styled-components
```

## Quick Start

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { SelectChat } from 'llm-select-and-chat';

function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: '600px', width: '400px' }}>
      <SelectChat 
        apiKey="your-openai-api-key"
        theme="light"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## With Custom Theme

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { SelectChat, createTheme, ThemeProvider } from 'llm-select-and-chat';

function App() {
  const customTheme = createTheme('light');
  customTheme.colors.primary = '#4a90e2';

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={customTheme}>
      <SelectChat apiKey="your-api-key" />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

## Handling Images

The component supports two ways of working with images:

### 1. Pasting Images in Chat

Paste images directly from clipboard:

1. Copy an image to your clipboard (e.g., take a screenshot)
2. Click on the chat input field
3. Paste using Ctrl+V / Cmd+V
4. Send with or without an accompanying text message

### 2. Selecting Images with Text

You can also select images on the page to include in the selection context:

```jsx
import { SelectChat, SelectableImage } from 'llm-select-and-chat';

function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <p>Select this text and click an image below to include both in your selection.</p>
        <div style={{ display: 'flex', gap: '10px' }}>
          <SelectableImage src="/image1.jpg" alt="Selectable image 1" />
          <SelectableImage src="/image2.jpg" alt="Selectable image 2" />
        </div>
      </div>
      
      <SelectChat apiKey="your-api-key" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Images are automatically rendered in the selection context, allowing the AI to discuss both the selected text and images together.

## Selection Context

When text is selected, the component captures context around the selection and makes it available to the AI assistant.

By default, the component only captures the immediate context around the selection. If you need the AI to have access to the entire document, you can enable full document extraction:

```jsx
<SelectChat 
  apiKey="your-openai-api-key"
  extractFullDocument={true}
/>
```

With full document extraction enabled, the complete text content of the page will be included with each selection, giving the AI assistant more comprehensive context.
