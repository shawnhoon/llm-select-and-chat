## Installation

```bash
# Install the package
npm install llm-select-and-chat

# Install peer dependencies (if not already in your project)
npm install react react-dom styled-components
```

## Quick Start

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { SelectChat } from 'llm-select-and-chat';

function App() {
  return (
    <div style={{ height: '600px', width: '400px' }}>
      <SelectChat 
        apiKey="your-openai-api-key"
        theme="light"
      />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## With Custom Theme

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { SelectChat, createTheme, ThemeProvider } from 'llm-select-and-chat';

function App() {
  const customTheme = createTheme('light');
  customTheme.colors.primary = '#4a90e2';

  return (
    <ThemeProvider theme={customTheme}>
      <SelectChat apiKey="your-api-key" />
    </ThemeProvider>
  );
}
```

## Handling Images

The component supports pasting images directly from clipboard:

1. Copy an image to your clipboard (e.g., take a screenshot)
2. Click on the chat input field
3. Paste using Ctrl+V / Cmd+V
4. Send with or without an accompanying text message

## Selection Context

When text is selected, the component captures context around the selection and makes it available to the AI assistant.

By default, the component only captures the immediate context around the selection. If you need the AI to have access to the entire document, you can enable full document extraction:

```jsx
<SelectChat 
  apiKey="your-openai-api-key"
  extractFullDocument={true}
/>
```

With full document extraction enabled, the complete text content of the page will be included with each selection, giving the AI assistant more comprehensive context.
